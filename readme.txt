These python scripts allow for:
1)	Batch import and conversion of psmsa or emsa files (NORAN/NSS) to csv 
2)	Extraction of key header parameters which are stored in a comprehensive file index 
3)	Tweakable automated background fitting of the x-ray background
4)	Adjustments for pathological overlap of adjacent peaks
5)	Integration of peak counts after background subtraction
6)	Batch plotting of all spectra including backgrounds to multipage PDF reports
7)	Quantitative compositional analyses via Cliff-Lorimer k-factor technique (including error propagation)
These scripts are currently just run from an IDE (such as Spyder) usually section-by-section which allows examination of results as they are generated.
